                <h2>Mardi Gras Traditions</h2><br>
                <p>Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in New
                    Orleans! <br><br>

                    Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves
                    with long beads caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids
                    with their families are everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade goers
                    will sit on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat great food and watch the crowds walk by between
                    parades. On Mardi Gras day, the majority of non-essential businesses are shut down because of the
                    celebration. <br><br>

                    Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all the beads and
                    trinkets they will catch from the parades! <br><br>

                    Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all begin, and how the traditions have changed.

                <h2>The Mardi Gras History</h2><br>
                <p>The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to <strong>medieval Europe,</strong> passing through Rome and
                    Venice in the
                    17th and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of
                    "Boeuf Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies. <br><br>
                    On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a
                    plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it <strong>"Pointe du Mardi
                        Gras"</strong> when his
                    men realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la
                    Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile
                    celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras. <br><br>

                    In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                    current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and
                    paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on
                    wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the
                    coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday. <br><br>

                    <strong>New Orleans was established in 1718</strong> by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was
                    celebrated openly in
                    New Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the
                    Marquis de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans
                    Mardi Gras balls of today. <br><br>
                    The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                    governing body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of
                    hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans. <br><br>
                    By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback
                    riders to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "<a
                        href="https://www.mardigrasneworleans.com/history/traditions/flambeaux">flambeaux,</a>" lit the
                    way for the
                    krewe's members and lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young
                    Mobile natives formed the <strong>Mistick Krewe of Comus,</strong> invoking John Milton's hero Comus
                    to represent
                    their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as
                    tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous. <br><br>

                <h3> Mayor of New Orleans</h3>
                <br>
                <p>As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit our city to experience the
                    excitement of Mardi Gras! <br><br>

                    Mayor of New Orleans<br><br>

                    The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called
                    Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big
                    event.<br><br>

                    Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private
                    Carnival clubs, called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade
                    goers. Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!"<br><br>
                    The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid
                    & Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes
